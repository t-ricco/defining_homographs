## Identifying Homographs

Homographs are words that have the same spelling, but different meanings. For example, in the sentence "The *charge* will be $5.00" 'charge' indicates the price of some good or service. However in the sentence "The defendant pled not guilty to the *charge*." the word 'charge' means the formal accusation of criminal behavior. A human who reads each of these sentences recognizes the difference by the context in which the word is being used. 

We would like to use machine learning to train a computer to do the same thing in order to prove the performance of search algorithms, speach recognition, or interactive AI. In this project, we focus on language used in scholarly writing.
