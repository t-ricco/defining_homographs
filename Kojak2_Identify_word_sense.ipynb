      "The proposed extracting method improves (1) the extraction quality of the system by increasing the precision of entity extraction as a result of the initial extracted entities from our method; our highly precised entities will be used as a seed for training other machine learning (ML) systems, across domains and languages, thus, not only eliminating the need for manual training but also will expand the seed (through learning) and therefore will continue to increase the precision and use of entity extraction across domains and languages; and (2) the experts’ experience and use: experts will spend less time for training the system (as is done by the seed entities created by us, and expended by ML) and also less time on fixing faulty entities and relationships extracted by the systems, thus, instead, will spend their time on using the system’s outcome to make better data-driven decision.This paper is organized as follows: the “” section presents a review of relevant literature for the theoretical concepts of the study; the “” section explains the proposed method for entity extraction; the “” section provides and discusses the study results; and the “” section concludes the study by summarizing the study’s contributions, limitations, and future research needs.The primary motivations for this study are to (1) improve the precision (eliminate noise) of identifying elements that belong to the two entities, Person and Organization; (2) eliminate the need for tagged documents used in training systems to identify entities of those two categories; this decreases experts’ time for both training the system and for evaluating the accuracy of extraction outcome (entities and relationships), thus instead allowing them spend more time in analyzing the system’s outcome and decision making; (3) create a high-precision seed entity list (for each of the two categories) that can be used to train ML systems over time and across multiple domains and languages.The main goal of this study was to increase the precision of extracting elements of certain categories.\n",

      "This research may benefit Chinese companies by providing guidance for human resources practices in how to adopt the recommendations of the emotional intelligence literature to select and train employees on emotional intelligence when jobs have high emotional demands (e.g., Clarke ; Slaski and Cartwright ).Therefore, I would like to contribute to the literature in the following three major ways: 1) By including six categories of occupation based on the Holland model and considering emotions in the Chinese cultural context, our research may provide more comprehensive empirical support to the basic arguments of the JD-R model, and explore how Chinese people experience and perceive emotional demands and exhaustion differently from westerners; 2) we further specifically include three typical types of social jobs in our investigation to enrich our empirical knowledge of the applicability of the JD-R model to social occupations in China; and 3) conceptually, our study also contributes to the JD-R model by incorporating job crafting in the Chinese context and examines the specific mechanism of the moderating role of emotional intelligence, in which both linear and nonlinear relationships are hypothesized.The present study is a relatively large-scale investigation conducted in China across six occupational types classified according to the Holland model.\n",
